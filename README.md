# WIP: Govibes 
An unnecessary rewrite of [mechvibes.com](https://mechvibes.com) (mechanical keyboard sound simulator) disguised as a CLI tool.

## Warning: Awful Code Ahead!
This is a project I built for myself. **Only tested on my machine**, so if it breaks yoursâ€”well, that's on you. Proceed at your own risk.

## Features (So Far)
- An interactive mode with fancy styling, as well as the ability to pass sound as arguments.
- Simulates different mechanical keyboard sound profiles right from your terminal.
- Built in Go, because why not?

## Installation and Usage
Will write soon!
